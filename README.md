# TripJournal

### A trip tracker and visualizer.

This app will allow users to capture aspects of their journey such as specific locations or the
geographic path (driving, flying, hiking) and pin pictures they have taken during the trip, so that
they can visualize the entire experience in a variety of ways. The app will utilize the Instagram
API to take pictures, the Foursquare API to mark locations, and the Twitter API to track tweets.
At the end of the trip, the user can generate a “story”, an interactive visualization of the trip in
card format, containing pinned pictures, maps, tweets, and foursquare check­ins. This can then
be shared with friends and social media and allow people to experience or reminisce the trip in
a fresh way. Users can also take pictures of their invoices and receipts and use them to
generate an expense report which would be useful for corporate trips.
